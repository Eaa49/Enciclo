Next, we will briefly present acromegaly and a bit of its history.

[The title "What is Acromegaly?" appears on screen]
What is Acromegaly?
Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by an excess of growth hormone,
usually due to a tumor in the pituitary gland.
This condition causes abnormal growth in bones and tissues.

A very famous case of gigantism related to acromegaly
is that of Robert Wadlow, also known as "The Giant of Alton."
Born in 1918 in Alton, Illinois, Wadlow grew to 2.72 meters in height,
making him the tallest person ever recorded in history.

Regarding the Physical and Social Impact,
despite his fame, Wadlow's life was complicated.
His size required specialized medical equipment
and custom-made shoes.

In addition, his mobility was limited.
Still, he became a public figure,
sponsored by a shoe company,
which allowed him to share his story and raise
awareness about his condition,
contributing to advances and research
and driving medical progress.
