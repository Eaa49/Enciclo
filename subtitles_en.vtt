Welcome to our Medical Encyclopedia.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Next, we will briefly present acromegaly and a bit of its history.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What is Acromegaly?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by an excess

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.000
of growth hormone, usually due to a tumor

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.000
in the pituitary gland.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
This condition causes abnormal growth in bones and tissues.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
A very famous case of gigantism related to acromegaly

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.500
is that of Robert Wadlow, also known as "The Giant of Alton."

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Born in 1918 in Alton, Illinois, Wadlow grew to 2.72 meters tall,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.000
making him the tallest person ever recorded in history.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.100
His extreme height was the result of continuous growth.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.300
Regarding the physical and social impact, despite his fame,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.200
Wadlow's life was complicated. His size required specialized medical equipment

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.200
and custom-made shoes.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.200
Additionally, his mobility was limited.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.200
Still, he became a public figure, sponsored by a footwear company.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.200
This allowed him to tell his story and raise awareness about his condition.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.200
Helping in research advancements and driving medical progress.

00:01:12.400  --> 00:01:15.200 
Thank you for your attention.
